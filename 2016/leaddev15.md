# Crystal Huff - Dealing with Impostor syndrome
@crystalhmhuff

## AFGO
Another Fkng Growth Opportunity

## Combatting
Ask a friend to tell u 3 strengths of yourself.
Think of someone you admire and realise they also have impostor syndrome.

## Why does it happen
_Fake it until you make it_ when successful feels like you've faked it.
The kyriarchy is rife in society. _Women are not supposed to be good at math_.
Public reveal of projects causes public critique.
Comparing our worst to a snapshot of someone elses best.
Being liked vs. being competent: false dichotomy
Internalized criticism: _Math is hard, let's go shopping_

## Result of Impostor syndrome 
Less effective as collaborators.
Nobody wants to be seen making a mistake.
Ask for less money, fewer promotions.
It's a barrier for people to be successful.
Leads to lower satisfaction (in life, work, ...).
Less likely to seek out a new job.
Comes down to marginalization and silence.

## Defenses
Iceberg illusion.
Only shows success.
Does not show: persistence, failure, dedication, sacrifice, disapointment, hard work, discipline.

Watch your words, don't say things like _I'm not an expert, but..._.
Say instead: _I'm working on that, ..._.

Document what you're working on, e.g. learning a new language.
Document for your community.

Talk with your friends about yours and their impostor syndrome.

Ask questions to make sure everyone is on the same page.

Compare yourself with yourself.

Make mentorship a first-class activity. Make sure your work and community values it.

Critique with kindness. And leave with kindness.
Compliments are better when they're personal: Positive, not physical, specific and honest.

When trying to change your habits, find yourself a replacement behavior.
To aid changing a mental route.

When you notice someone else is struggling with impostor syndrome, help them remind themselves of happy thoughts/experiences.

Know that every expert was once a beginner.
