# Monica Piotrowicz - Stepping up to be a leader of leaders.
@monsika

## Her thoughts on being a lead 
Can be difficult feedback on your leadership role
How can I be less reactive and more strategic?
What's next?

## Growth caused her to lead leads
Because of her own path she knew how to help her leads.
Felt that she could prepare for this.
Teaching "how to lead" helped gain her a lot more insight than she could get from books.

## When should you be thinking about leading leads
Certainly before you actually need a lead.

A lead will have some combination of
tech knowledge and skills,
understanding of the business and product,
and trust from their team.
__all so they can help develop their team__

Can't build a version of someone in 1 day that has all those qualities.
So you want to encourage those traits on your entire team.

## Starting to prep
### Ask
Asking _Have you considered leading a team one day?_ to people in the team.
You're not promising but you are learning about their goals.

### Talk about what you (as a lead) do
Like asking if they like a food they haven't tried before.
Leadership is a different kind of problem solving might make opportunity more interesting.
Talk about how you define your own productivity (because ur still getting stuff done)
They can hold you accountable for the stuff you say you do (which is good)

### Create opportunities
By delegating your tasks.
You're probably doing too much tactical stuff anyway.
Make space.
Be strategic about those opportunities.

## Leads to growth mindset

## Setting expectations & measuring performance
Align expectations with candidate leads by writing down collaboratively the expectations and responsibilities of being a lead.
Monica used her own questions to help with this.

### Growth path
Most impactful thing I can do today is ...
Right now I'm not great at ...
In a few months I want to try...

### Accept that your leads will wanna do things their own way
Remember to give space.
You'll learn yourself from their perspective.

_I trust you to do the right thing - here's a list of things you should do_ lulz.

Try to build alignment.

### Become a coach
Make sure your leads are thinking about their blindspots.
Give tools to have them make the good decisions.

## Make Space
Every time you think you're protecting your team by going to the meeting yourself, delegate to the team instead.

### Take new space
Become an expert at what you, and only you, can do.
Go back to list of expectations you created with your leads and apply it to yourself
