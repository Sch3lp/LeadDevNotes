Take your time and nail this mock press release.
Also ignore all the constraints (e.g. not within current company boundaries, but also ignore technical constraints)
If you're not excited after reading the press release, it's probably not worth persuing.

#### FAQs
Add meat to the skeleton provided by the press release. Include questions that came up while writing the press release.
By figuring out these questions you become more specific all the while.
From perspective of customers and stakeholders.

#### Mockups
Involve designers.
Tell story on how a customer uses the product.

#### Loop
Iterate over all of this (Living) documentation.
