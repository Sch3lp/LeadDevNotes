# Penny Wyatt - Overhead, not downtrodden
@pennozewyatt

## Shift accountability to QA
To also be accountible not only for quality, but also for development speed.
Stopped being testing team, started being quality _assistance_ team.
Helped devs become accountable and interested in quality.

## Bugfix team

## Lessons learned
Embrace you're in an overhead team.
Broaden your view, work towards the company and customers goals.
Cost is not value. (3 months extra work is not value, it was cost; same for managers trying to get quality, when they can get more value from a smaller team by improving performance)
Leaders are overhead too, so focus on where you can add value.
