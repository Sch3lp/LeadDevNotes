# Heidi Waterhouse - The 7 righteous fights
_That you should be fighting_
@wiredferret

If you wait until release, you'll have more resistance to fix it.
Like poking chocolate chips in an already baked cookie.

1. Localization
Don't hard code UI elements
No words in logos or images
Bake in extended character support (don't be the jerk that disrespects correct spelling of your users names)

2. Security
_Internet is not a series of tube connected to hackers wearing hoodies_
Security is neither cheap nor easy, but it's better than the alternative.
Bake in room for encryption.
Destroy data. The more data you keep, the more threatsurface
Don't roll your own security platform.
Stop saying the word "secure", when you mean authorization or authentication or ...

3. Extensibility
What makes you so sure that internal API is gonna stay internal forever?

4. Documentation
Is not state secrets, it's subtle self promotion. (inventive designers!)
Write Developer onboarding documentation
Document production scripts and build sequences.
Secretive build engineers are bad build engineers.
Release notes are your most important documentation. Deserves a little more love. (here are issues fixed, here are incompatibilities, ...)

5. Affordance
Subtle clues on how a user is supposed to be using something.
_Just because that's where it ought to go, doesn't mean that's where users want it._
Some people have more privileges. So turn ur privileges down to actual user level when you test.

6. Acceptance
Get actual users and don't explain anything. Change software to meet user experience.
If you can't hire an expert, become a student. _Cathy Sierra - Making users awesome_.

7. Accessibility
"Eventually" we're all going to need it.
8% of men are colorblind, none of them go into UX
Screen reader links. (How miserable is your product if you can't click on the links)
Take into account varying data-speeds.
Temporarily Able Bodied, do it for your future self if not for somebody else.

Check KhanAcademy or github for accessibility and usability tests.

Use money as lever as : compound interest

Don't build in compounding technical debt that you could trivially avoid.

Be productively lazy. (be interested in saving time).
