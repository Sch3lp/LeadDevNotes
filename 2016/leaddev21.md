# Laura Czajkowski - how to deal with cultural divide internal advocacy within distributed teams
@czajkowski

## Problems working remote
### Different timezones.
Lookup _Figure it out_ chrome app (shows timezones)

Make flexible hours. Try to make your workhours work for you.

### Information is social
No watercooler when working remotely.

Please talk online (does not cut off remote team members)

### Neverending meetings & connections
_Can you hear me now?_

Try to be consistent with your tools.

## Embrace differences
## Advocate internally
Share your teams achievements and say thank you to those that do.
Celebrate achievements.
## Reward with opportunity
e.g. sending them to conferences

## Improvements
Onboarding, documentation, mentoring, support (virtual lunch), face to face meetings irl.
Take small time (e.g. during standup) to get to learn each other (instead of going for drinks after works).
e.g. tell teammembers to bring and show their beverages they're currently drinking.
