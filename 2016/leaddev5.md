## Systems theory
things and connection between things, latter are usually more interesting
structure of a system determines its behavior
also works vice versa
feedback is output of a system reentered as input into the same system.
feedback can have delays

Adaptive systems rely on feedback, it changes behavior depending on the feedback it gets.

Accelerating loop
"Shifting the burden to the intervener"

Diminishing loop
"Tragedy of the Commons"
suppresses behavior, e.g. bad behavior

Balancing loop
"Limits to Growth"
feedback works toward stable goal.
Factories outputting into river had to dump their output "upstream".

Thrashing "loop"
"Boom and bust"
flips between states (e.g. shower control, wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_distribution_game)

Small and frequent is better than large and infrequent, works for both systems and people.

Delay in feedback increases @drift@, reduces system's responsiveness, limits options (only old data), increases processing effort.
Lean Operations prefers small batch size, enables much more control points.

Why offer feedback:
to improve system,
to model a culture of encouraging feedback
to control others
to demonstrate our superior knowledge

When you offer feedback, question your own motivation.

Feedback itself is a system.
Offered or sought -> Heard -> Actioned -> Offered or Sought...
All three need to be working to have an active loop.

## Delivering feedback
Feedback should be about behavior
Is usually heard at personal level
_Your work is sloppy_ becomes _You are a sloppy worker_
-->
_Your work has been sloppy recently_ (still not great)
On this specific occasion your work was substandard
If you did these things your work quality would improve
If you did these things you would make me happier

SBI: a model
Situation Behavior Impact

Situation is specific... an example when.
Generalisations tend to learn on a personal level.

Behaviour, what things were done.
you want to try to avoid judging words.

Impact is me (how I felt)

Example:
In the team meeting on Friday
you spoke across me several times
so I felt like I wasn't being allowed to share my opinion with the team

## Structuring feedback
Difference is in between level of trust

Porpoise feedback
When you feedback with only positive,
Offer specific positive regards
Assume everything will self-correct
Everything else will self-correct

Best possible way to interact with a new group, or new person, that are particularly vulnerable (because of new role/position)

Sandwich feedback
Offer specific positive regard
Offer a growing edge (if you did this, it would be even better)
End with general positive regard

Atkins feedback
Kind of like Sandwich feedback, but without bread.
Offer a growing edge

Wprks well in a well established relation.

## Receiving feedback
Say "Thank you". There is no step 2.
Even when you're angry.
Map it to SBI yourself.
