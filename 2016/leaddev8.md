How networks influence hiring and retention in tech

## Support motivation feedback
Ways in which contacts have your back
Some friends are able to motivate you, others are able to provide technical guidance. Be aware of this.

## I love the way you're applying...
...but actually I just recognize my habitus in yours

Habitus = social, educational and cultural background

Kevins are bad. --> bias.
People are biased to recruit/like other people people that are "like us".

## Size matters
Social origin shapes network size and diversity.

The bigger your network the bigger the chance you'll find someone suitable for the job.

## That's not right...
...and other stuff working class folks say when passing chances

_This is not fair_

If your HR Processes are too strict, take too long or rely heavily on personal recommendations, you're essentially excluding whole groups of people from your high potential and growth list.

## I didn't have any help
It's a lie. Most of us have had help.

As long as you have chances, you're supposed to take these chances.

## Retention
### The first bonds often stick
Why your company should offer structured get-togethers.

## No Man's an island
But many women_ are.

To most women, their colleagues aren't their friends.

## Company culture is not about drinks
If your team can't bond without free drinks, try again. Because you might exclude women.
Do something in the middle of the day.

## TL;DL
Check your processes, your networks and yourself.
Are they varied, have same educational background, spend night gaming, speak or dress the same way?
Then your network is too homogeneous.
This might turn your networks into gatekeepers instead of gates.
