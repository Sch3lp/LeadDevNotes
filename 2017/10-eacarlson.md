@eacarlson

Detroit Labs: training 60 people, 86% retainment

## Types of feedback
affirmative, constructive feedback
passive feedback: devalue or condone behaviour through **inaction**

Feedback is important in controlling the mosquito, so it doesn't turn into a monster

giving and receiving feedback requires openness maturity self-awareness courage vulnerability

## Getting over fear of feedback
What am I afraid of?
What's the underlying fear?
What steps could I take to overcome this fear?
What could I gain by moving beyond this fear?

On receiving constructive feedback: act as if the feedback is coming from someone you adore
