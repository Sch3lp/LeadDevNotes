# Fail Safe, Fail Smart, Succeed - Kevin Goldsmith
@KevinGoldsmith

_Invention requires failure_

Current Development Release cycle allows for smaller controlled experiments instead of huge failures.

## Not punishing failures
Not punishing does not mean there's no accountability. Punish not learning from failure.

## Failing teaches you something about
process
team
perception of customers
understanding of product
yourself

Retrospectives on projects but with focus on making future projects better.
