# We're Agile, we don't do doumentation - Birgitta BÃ¶ckeler

Bad reasons of writing documentation: for the sake of the process.

5 reasons why doc's are valuable:

## 1. Create common understanding
Put up individuals understandings on a whiteboard (in groups, diverge, converge, ...)
Make a _wall_ of common understanding

(SWF Visits can be a means of keeping a common understanding wall up to date)

## 2. Surface and understand complexity
Make _infographics_. (Digital ones evolved from whiteboard sessions)
Complex things that you don't touch frequently, but need to explain in detail every time you do touch it.
Creating these infographics helps you check if it's accidental complexity or actual.

Make _Widget Kits_. Kits that are helpful in rebuilding diagrams (tangible)

## 3. Create empathy
Empathy between tech decision makers and developers.

Developing software without doc guidance can be anxiety inducing.

Empathy between product people and ddevelopers.

## 4. Documenting reasons why
Michael Nygard: documenting-architecture-decisions

Describe the problem, not just the solution. (add context)

## 5. Creative problem solving
The back of the napkin - Dan Roam
Temporary drawings are OK. Don't worry about staying up to date

## guidance
As little as possible
Make it visible
Include in rituals (grooming the diagrams, e.g. in a codereview)
Create ownership through collaboration (architecture sessions)
