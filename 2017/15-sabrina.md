## How to sell it 
Make the pain visible with
diagrams and
metaphors (personal hygiene, hoarders, gardening, ...)

Repeat yo'self. It will take time and persistence.

## Doing it
Use strangler approach.
Identify Bone, Muscle and Fat (features).
Find biggest blocker/highest impact, make realistic plan to remove it completely and do it.

Celebrate:
* write an obituary for the removed application/module
* party poppers on achievement badges in the office.
