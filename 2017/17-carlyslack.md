# Mentoring Junior Engineers at Slack HQ - Carly Robinson
@carlyhasredhair

Used to be an actor.

Makes analogy with ballet because of engineering as a craft -> good and strong basics are super important

Mentorship is a relationship, figure out if it'll be a good fit before it's too late.
Take time to ask questions and listen.
Encourage self reflection.
Make explicit: learning style and teaching style. Align expectations between mentor and mentee.
Be respectful in codereviews etc.

Growth infrastructure:
* Opt-In personal and professional development funds
* Brownbag presentations
* Non-technical workshops
* Office hours with top engineers
