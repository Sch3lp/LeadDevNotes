# Implementers, Solvers and Finders - Randall Koutnik

_Rethinking the developer career path_

Senior developer has a genernally bad definition:
-> expensive
-> bored
-> opinionated
-> from minnesota
-> defined by years of experience

New definition of Senior:
New Words!!
* That are quantifiable.
* Describe the work we do.

Experience should rather be described

### Solution Implementer
smaller breadth of problems to solve (with code)

### Problem Solver
bigger breadth of problems to solve (with solutions), more empowerment (to keep improving)

### Problem Finder
given context, discovers & prioritizes new problems
also break it down in smaller problems, and also implement them (in code!).

Base should be big enough to hold the next level (like a pyramid staircase)
