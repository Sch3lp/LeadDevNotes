# How to talk to earthlings - Adrian Howard

Have more effective conversations with your teams.

The managers job is to build the organization, not the product.
_The art of getting things done through people_ - Mary Parker Follett.

Understand their problems, understand their goals.

Used knowledge from UX research.

## Biggest mistakes you can to foul up effective conversations

### 1. Not listening. 
Fix it by shutting up (stop talking), and staying quiet.
Gaps seem longer than you think, people will naturally fill gaps.
When someone stops talking, just wait four or five seconds.

### 2. Not hearing what was actually said
_Can you tell me more about the TDD problems with the QA group?_
Shows that you're actually listening.
Allows you to dive deeper into the problem they described (with their specific words).
Allows to redirect.
_Every clarification breeds new questions_

### 3. Asking about the future
Bad: _What would you do if this thing happened?_.
Because the answer you hear is likely to not be good, because people are generally bad at imagining.

Good: Ask for stories
_Can you tell me about a really bad day for you?_
_What happens on your worst day?_
_What was the best/worst day last week_

### 4. Leading questions
Ask open questions instead.
Don't: _You think QA needs more training in TDD?_
Do: _Can you tell me more about the problems in QA?_

### 5. Being disrespectful
People in one on one's will know when you are bored (of hearing the same problem 4 times in a row)

So don't be scary. Don't be an arse. Pay extra attention to good manners, introducing yourself properly.
Pay attention to your own body language. Or rather, remember your body language.

### 6. Trusting your memory
Write up your notes during the conversation/meeting.
Write down the things you wanna bring up later. Use it as a driver.
Write down in a way that you'll be able to understand at a later point in time.

Try to separate insights and observations.
Insights are conclusions you've drawn from what people have said.

## Summed up
**Stalk** before you **talk** before you **sell** before you **build**

Be _Alfred_, help your heroes be better.
