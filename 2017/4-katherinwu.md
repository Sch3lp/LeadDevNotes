??Ask Metafilter??

Guess culture, could also be described as offer culture (because you won't ask directly, feel it out, and then others will pick it up and offer)

Understanding the difference is useful to know how to get your message across to "someone from the other side".

## Ask culture
+
Prioritizes efficiency
No ambiguity
Gets what you want (short term)

-
More open to conflict
Can make people feel uncomfortable

## Guess culture
+
Prioritizes not hurting feelings
More polite
Expressive

-
Depends on tight net of shared expectations
Hard if you're bad at reading social cues
Can feel like no one is listening to you

Different styles can be more appropriate for different situations

## Strategies
### Ask culture dealing with guess culture
Make a Guess Culture close friend
Listen more closely (it's also about what people don't say)
Apologize if you realize an ambiguous interpretation

Ask "What questions do you have for me" instead of "Do you have any questions?"

### Guess culture dealing with ask culture
Remember that people might be unaware of "the rules" (of guess culture)
Resist the urge to "soften" a "No"
