# Leadership lessons from the agile manifesto - Anjuan Simmons

Hero's Journey cycle

Hero gets mentored.

The law of influence: true measure of leadership is influence. Nothing more. Nothing less.
Leaders that got buy-in from people that follow.

Like code smells, are there also influence smells?

_Preserve dignity at all costs_ -> one way to keep a team motivated
You can disagree but still maintain dignity.

_working always ships faster than perfect_

Collaboration over contract negotiation
_Customers trust colleagues not contracts_

Every hour spent with a toxic customer is an hour you didn't spend with a good customer that actually trusts you. (build better relationships)

_don't fear surprises fear flexibility_
