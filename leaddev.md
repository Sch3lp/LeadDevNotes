# Patrick Kua - What I wish I knew as a first time tech lead
@patkua

### Path as dev is known: lot's of clearly defined technologies to want to learn.

### Path as dev lead is unknown: what "stuff" do u need to know?
Mistakes impact the entire team.
* Writing code all the time: mistake
* Making all the technical decisions (you won't have all the necessary knowledge to make proper decisions): mistake
* People - that's someone else's problem: mistake
* The team know what they're doing --> provide guidance
* They'll resolve arguments themselves

### Path as a wiser dev lead
1. Accepts that things are no longer just binary, and that this is a "natural" state. Getting a sense of the right direction.
2. You don't need to have all the answers. And this is ok since you've got a whole team to depend on.
3. Your role is not to be liked by everyone (man, boy, donkey fable, plot twist)
4. You are not alone (build your own support network, find your own coach to bounce ideas off of)
5. Non technical areas are just as important.
6. People are complex (all snowflakes with own weaknesses and strengths)
7. You can't do everything yourself (time mgmt is key) --> Use Situational Leadership Model  (x:direction behaviour, y:supporting behaviour; Delegate, Tell, Participate, Sell)
Logically goes from tell to sell to participate to delegate (in phases
8. There are many ways to be a leader
Coach
Shepherd
Shaman (storytelling)
Champion
9. Secret power = saying no. Focus on where you can add the most value.
10. Your role gives you greater impact. Instead of becoming the 10x dev, grow your teams individuals a little bit so your team becomes the 10x dev
