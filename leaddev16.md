# Gil Zellner - How not to burn out your prod team
@heathenaspargus

Cost of hiring new employee is 1.5-3x their salary.

## Easy changes (day)
Mandatory half day off after night production issue.
Allocate weekly time to resolve or automate issues that kept us up at night.
Wider rotation (more people on call).
Follow the sun (if you have multiple timezones).

## Medium (months)
ALERT ALL THE THINGS leads to alert fatigue.
So only alert on symptoms, not suspected "causes",
Only alert on actionable stuff,
Only alert on business breaking stuff.
Direct alerts to relevant parties.
LOG ALL THE THINGS leads to overwhelming stuff
especially if you log success.

Connect detection scripts to correction scripts.
See Facebook Auto Remediation.

## Hard (years)
AWS stuff
