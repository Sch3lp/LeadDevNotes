Choosing strawberries --> choosing a company to work for
Box vs. transparent film with calorie count etc.

Create relationship between your team (not just devs) and future devs ~ employee evangelism

Hire good people -> do awesome stuff -> share with the community -> hire good people

## How to encourage your team to become employee evangelists
Like making your users badass (see book), make your team badass.
So they feel more inclined to share (publicly).

By giving them a compelling context and reason, help them keep wanting to, help them actually get better.


### Give compelling context
Be great, Be authentic, Be open.

### Give compelling reason
Help others, 
Build confidence in communication, (as a company help people get good)
Build personal reputation.

All in all: understand your teams motivations.

### Keep them wanting to
... work on this

What makes them stop? Understand fears and blockers.
_I'm not an expert, I can't write, too nervous, not a good speaker, nothing I do is worth speaking about_

What pulls them forwards?
Help them break a goal up into smaller goals (personal)

Lead by example

### Help them actually get better
#### Perpetual exposure
To become an expert at something, get exposed to high quality content of that something (expose to good examples)
e.g. start a library (with articles, books, blogposts, ...)

Brown bag watch presentations and discuss afterwards

#### Highlight existing good content (that you've done yourself).
Be the voice that champions the work that the team is already doing.

#### Deliberate practice
Speaking and writing skills
e.g. Lightning talks (in-house), weekly learning hour (hour long courses), "Conference Club" (proposals, ideas for talks, ...)
e.g. Collaboration blogposts (ask paragraph submissions), internal blogs, pair on blogposts.

## Results
All of these increase public visibility.
50% of interviewees mention seeing blogposts, ...

## Conclusion
It's about making team better and reaping results for free.
Help colleagues share their cool stuff with the world.
