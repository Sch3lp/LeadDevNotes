# Camille Fournier - Rebooting Culture
@skamille

Person who hired her, left.
She asked for his job, got it. Thought she'd nail it.
Didn't know anything about being an exec or mgmt.
4 months in, on her review she got told she created a culture of fear.
Was a wake up call. Figured out how to lead people, not assault them.

## Speed
Making sure your team can work as fast as they can is one of the most important things you can do.

Engineers **like** to ship. Wanna be able to say that they work on something relevant.

Avoid creating resource constraints.
(e.g. code freeze) Getting things marked as done.
That's why you want to be impatient with tasks that seem like they take too long.
Think about how you can make them faster (remove bottlenecks from ur team).

## Structure
Good structure helps you get context quickly.
Structure comes from failure.
Failure in structure usually leads to getting rid of that structure. But is not always the way to go.

_Ambiguity is a bias factor_ (vagueness in job or role descriptions)
What you want is transparancy.

Structure is not how to detail instructions on how to do it.
If you find yourself doing this, ask yourself if you can't automate that.

## Relatedness
Vulnerability (see slides) is opposite of culture of fear.
Psych safety > Dependability > Structure & Clarity > Meaning > Impact (learning from google teams)

Best thing to do with guilt is to apologize.
If you don't do anything with feelings of guilt is you get to shame, and shame is toxic.

## Conflict
You need to have healthy conflict, because it draws out important data.
_No criticisms if you can't come up with solutions_ is a bad thing to say to people, ask them to **really** articulate their criticism.

Replace feelings of conflict with curiousity.

_A meeting consists of a group of people who have little to say - until after the meeting_

Move fast, reduce feedback loops, to let people get quick wins. Engineers like to ship.
Be transparant about structure and seek out learning from failure.

Empathy is a learnable skill.
Ask people how they are, also listen to them, take time to feel your feelz.
