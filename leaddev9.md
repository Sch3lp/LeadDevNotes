# Joel Chippindale - Telling stories through your commits
@joelchippindale

Key challenge as lead dev is managing complexity.
Naming, code design, refactoring, automated tests are all about communicating the intent of our software.
VCS is underused in this regard.

_Every line of code is always documented_

## 3 Principles
### Make atomic commits
Minimum viable commit. What's the smallest useful change u can make to ur codebase.

### Write good commit messages
see slides

### Revise your developent history before sharing
With rebase.

## How to persuade the team to adopt these practices?
atomic commits make it simpler to write/think code.
