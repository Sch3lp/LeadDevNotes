We first started off day 2 of leaddev with a talk by Michael Lopp about his experience leading. This is really one to watch when it comes out.
He mentioned a gaming experience (Destiny), where a guy he usually plays with is able to take on a leadership role (in random pick-up groups) and this guy is _Unfailingly Kind_.
This really hit home with me, because I try to be this guy every time I play in a PUG to make sure the game's community stays open and non-toxic.

There are companies here, e.g. Zalando with company t-shirts that have _We Dress Code_ on their backs.
Thought that was pretty cool. Thought we don't really feel connected to our (Cegeka's) slogan _In close cooperation_.
Feels awkward, I feel I don't represent that sentiment.
Maybe because we have multiple _identities_ within Cegeka. How does one manage this properly?

Then we watched Ryan Alexander talk about _Hacking verbal communication systems_, in which he introduced us to Occupy hand gestures (they stole it from the Quakers btw).

----

After Ryan Alexanders talk about hacking verbal communication systems, Yan Cui took us on a tour of (programming) languages, highlighting all the neat stuff in different languages such as F#, Clojure and Rust.
Usually on how those languages compiler can help you describe intent much better in certain cases.
He also told us that the spend "10,000 hours to become the best" is overrated, and that 20 hours can already suffice to learn basics of something new you can build upon.
He advised to not learn a new language (syntax), but learn a new paradigm instead, to become more personally diverse.

Then Crystal Huff enlighted us about the _Impostor Syndrome_. It's not a disease, but a state in which you think you feel underqualified but when in reality you're really not.
_Impostor syndrome_ can have real consequences such as being less effective as collaborators (because nobody wants to be seen making a mistake), will get fewer promotions (because they feel unworthy), etc.
In the end the negative impact comes down to marginalization and being silenced.
It gets fed by things like _Fake it until you make it_, when if successful, you'll really have been an imposter. Other things that feed into it are phrases like _Women are bad at math_, or worse giving in to those stereotypes where you say _Math is hard, let's go shopping_.
Other important, notable things that might trigger it are comparing your worst snapshot to someone elses best snapshot, and the _Being Liked vs. Being Competetent_ dichotomy.
Combatting it involves (as usual) gaining more awareness. e.g. by asking your colleagues or friends about your strengths, realizing your heroes struggle with this as well, and picturing the iceberg image @jansabbe posted.
Preventing it involves watching what you say e.g. _I'm not an expert, but..._. If you repeat that often enough you'll eventually believe it. 
Compare yourself with yourself. Where were you yesterday, where are you today and where will you be tomorrow (on your personal scale).
Help preventing it in others by critiqueing with kindness. Compliments are better when they're personal: Positive, not physical, specific and honest.
When you notice someone else is struggling with impostor syndrome, help them remind themselves of happy thoughts/experiences.
As an exercise, fill in the blanks:
Hello! My name is

We switched to a more 'techie' track with Gil Zellner giving tips on how not to burn out your production (operations) team.
**Caution** Do **NOT** watch this presentation or the slides if you haven't seen Game of Thrones episode 9 of season 6 yet, there's a massive spoiler in his slides. :)
Easy changes you can do to help (takes days to implement):
Mandatory half day off after night production issue.
Allocate weekly time to resolve or automate issues that kept us up at night.
Wider rotation (more people on call).
Follow the sun (if you have multiple timezones).
Medium changes you can do (things that might take months to implement)
ALERT ALL THE THINGS leads to alert fatigue.
So only alert on symptoms, not suspected "causes",
Only alert on actionable stuff,
Only alert on business breaking stuff.
Direct alerts to relevant parties.
LOG ALL THE THINGS can tremendously help the team that gets woken out of their beds at night, but can lead to overwhelming stuff, especially if you also log success.
Connect detection scripts to correction scripts.
See Facebook Auto Remediation.
For the hard things (that might take years) he mentioned some AWS stuff I didn't pick up on (see slides).

Monica Piotrowicz talked about her experience of growing into a leader of dev leads.
A lead will have some combination of
tech knowledge and skills,
understanding of the business and product,
and trust from their team.
__all so they can help develop their team__
Can't build a version of someone in 1 day that has all those qualities.
So you want to encourage those traits in your entire team.
You can do this by first of all simply asking who's up for becoming a lead (in the future), talk about what it involves, and create opportunities for those candidates.
To help your colleagues and yourself grow, fill in the blanks
Most impactful thing I can do today is ...
Right now I'm not great at ...
In a few months I want to try ...
Remember to _Make Space_ for your candidates to grow. _I trust you to do the right thing - here's a list of things you should do_ is not how you make space :)
Every time you think you're protecting your team by going to the meeting yourself, delegate to the team instead.

Then Thomas Lobinger from Amazon talked about his/their (literally) backwards approach of aligning a team on values and creating a shared vision.
They create _Living Documentation_ by first creating a mock `Press Release`, then they create a `FAQ` document (from perspective of customers and stakeholders), then they create `Mockups` with their designers that need to tell a story of how a user would use the product they're going to build.
Of course they iterate over these documents as they learn and create their shared vision and values.
I also wrote down to google "Werner mock press release".

Penny Wyatt of Atlassian gave us tips on working in Quality Assurance (testing):
Embrace you're in an overhead team.
Broaden your view, work towards the company and customers goals.
Cost is not value. (3 months extra work is not value, it was cost; same for managers trying to get better quality by adding more devs, when they can get more value AND quality from a smaller team by improving performance)
Leaders are overhead too, so focus on where you can add value.

Then Melinda Seckington gave a very interesting talk about _How to succeed at hiring without really trying_.
She made a compelling analogy of choosing between a closed box that had the label _Strawberries_ on it, or a transparant box where you could see the Strawberries along with a label containing nutritional value etc., is like choosing a company you want to work for.
She continued on how they do it at FutureLearn, with a whole bunch of tactics, always focused on __helping__ colleagues write and speak.
This was pretty eye opening for me. Sometimes I'll notice an interesting story someone can tell, and ask them to blog about it, but they never do.
I'll change my approach by offering to help them write/prepare for a speech.
In short, I think Cegeka HR (and our CC leads) should definitely watch this presentation when it releases.

Laura Czajkowski gave a talk about remote working, mentioning very recognizable issues (like no watercooler talk etc.).
Pro-tip was to bring your beverage to the stand-up on fridays and talk about it, and your weekend a bit (to provide a moment for getting to know each other a bit better).
Most other stuff she talked about we're already doing AFAIK, like still meeting irl, celebrate successes, share watercooler decisions, making flexible work hours, etc.

Then to close things off Camille Fournier talked to us about _Rebooting Culture_, talking of her own experience bringing a _Culture of Fear_ to the team she first managed, noticing that and changing it around.
Her talk consisted of talking about a couple areas.
_Speed_, Making sure your team can work as fast as they can is one of the most important things you can do. So remove _resource constraints_ (like code freezes), and be impatient with things that seem to take too long.
_Structure_, Good structure helps you get context quickly. Structure comes from failure. _Ambiguity is a bias factor_ (vagueness in job or role descriptions, leaves room for interpretation that gets filled in according to biases). What you want is transparancy (another nod to our HR and CC leads here, you're picking up on this right?). Structure is not how to detail instructions on how to do it. If you find yourself doing this, ask yourself if you can't automate that.
_Relatedness_, Vulnerability (see slides) is the opposite of a culture of fear.
_Conflict_, You need to have healthy conflict, because it draws out important data. _You can't critisize if you can't come up with solutions_ is a bad thing to say to people, ask them to **really** articulate their criticism instead. Replace feelings of conflict with curiousity.
She closed off her talk by saying _Empathy is a learnable skill._, which is a very important statement actually. Anyone can do this fairly easily by simply asking people how they are (even if you don't care all that much).
And finally, take time to feel your feelz.

To me this was a very interesting conference. I knew soft/people skills would be put in the spotlight, but I still expected more technical talks than we got.
I am very happy with the content White October events provided in the nice venue of the Queen Elizabeth II Centre. 
I'd rate this conference a solid 5/7.
No but really, I'd recommend this conference to everyone. Especially to team coaches, scrum masters, developers, anyone that has anything to do with HR, and even program managers. 

I noticed I've been writing just over 100 lines, and I still left out a whole lot of my notes, so maybe I'll still write a blog post about all of the talks.
Is there anyone that wants to help me do just that? Someone that has never written a blog post for example, but is interested in starting their own.
